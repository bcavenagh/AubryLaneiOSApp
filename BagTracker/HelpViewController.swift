                     FAQItem(question: "How do I find my Amulet?", answer: "To find your Amulet click on either the \"Home\" tab or the \"Find My Amulet\" tab.

                     FAQItem(question: "How do I add emergency contacts?", answer: "To add emergency contacts open the left side menu and click the \"Emergency Contacts\" page. Once the page is opened, if you have not set your Amulet's number in the app before you will be prompted to add your Amulet's phone number to the app. Once this has been done, to add a contact click the \"+\" button on the top right of the screen. You will then be prompted to enter your contacts information. After you enter the information click the \"Done\" button. The app will then give you an informational warning, this is to notify you that the app will need to open your Messages app in order to send a programming text message to your Amulet.

Simply press the send button on the text message and the Amulet will be programmed with the correct emergency contact. Re-open the \"Emergency Contacts\" page once this is completed to view the updated table of emergency contacts. You may only add 5 emergency contacts to your Amulet.

                     FAQItem(question: "How do I set a geo-fence?", answer: "To set a geo-fence open the left side menu by clicking the button on the top left of the screen. Select the \"Geo-Fence\" tab and wait for the map to zoom into your Amulet's location. Confirm that this is where your Amulet is located and if it is an incorrect location then place your Amulet outside or near a window for 5-10 minutes so that a connection to the satellite can be re-established. If the location for the Amulet is correct then click the circular \"+\" button in the bottom right corner of the screen to add a geo-fence. Enter your desired size for the geo-fence (The fence must be at least 330 feet, 100 meters). Once you enter the desired size of the fence click \"Confirm\" you will be presented a warning. This is to notify you that the app will need to open your Messages app in order to send a programming text message to your Amulet. Accept the warning and your Messages app will be opened.

Simply press the send button on the text message and the Amulet will be programmed with the correct geo-fence. The map on the \"Geo-Fence\" page of the app will now display a blue circle around your amulet which represents the where the geo-fence is. Once the fence is set you should notice that the circular \"+\" button as changed to a circular trash button. To remove the geo-fence, click this button and send the preformatted text message that will pop-up. Again, DO NOT edit this text. After you send the text the circle on you map should disappear and the trash button should return to the \"+\"."),
                     FAQItem(question: "How do I set my preferred contact for making calls from the Amulet?", answer: "A preferred contact is the contact that will be called when you press the side button on the Amulet to make a call. (See: \"Making a Phone Call from the Amulet\" for more information.) To set this contact open the left side menu and click the \"Side Phone Button\" tab. Note: You must have your emergency contacts set up before you can continue. To setup your emergency contacts see the \"How do I add emergency contacts?\" section. Once this page is open you should see a list of your emergency contacts. You should see a \"Select\" button located next to each contact. Click Select on your preferred contact and you will be prompted to confirm this choice. Once you confirm you will be presented a warning. This is to notify you that the app will need to open your Messages app in order to send a programming text message to your Amulet. Accept the warning and your Messages app will be opened. DO NOT edit the text message to the Amulet as an improper format will result in the Amulet not being able to set the preferred contact properly and the app will then contain false information. Simply press the send button on the text message and the Amulet will be programmed with the correct preferred contact. You can switch your preferred contact at any point just click Select on your next choice and send the preformatted text and the preference will be updated."),
                     FAQItem(question: "Making a Phone Call from the Amulet", answer: "To make a call, press and hold the side button for 3 seconds and you will hear a beep.

                     FAQItem(question: "Interacting with the Map", answer: "The map is a standard Apple Map and works the same as your provided Maps app. To zoom in/out pinch the screen. This will allow you to see where your Amulet is located with more clarity. The map also has two different settings, Satellite and Standard. Standard shows a flat map with all the roads labeled and various other information provided by Apple Maps. Satellite shows a satellite view of the world so that you can see a real, bird's eye view of the world. To switch the views use the segmented switcher control located at the bottom of the map."),
                     FAQItem(question: "Why does the app need to send text messages from my phone?", answer: "To program your Amulet to include your contact's information and various other data it must be sent text messages. We are currently working on a way to send instructions to the Amulet without having to open your Messages app but until that time we need to access your Messages app and send text messages through that. Note: This does not allow us or the application to read any of your texts - your Messages app is still completely private. We are simply formatting a text message and opening the application for you so all you need to do is press the send button and you will be returned to our application. You will receive confirmation receipts from the Amulet letting you know that the text message was received and the Amulet was programmed correctly - you can simply ignore or delete these messages. The conversation between your phone and the Amulet does not need to be saved so you may delete it at any point."),
                     FAQItem(question:"What do I do when my Amulet is not showing up on the map?",answer:"If your Amulet is not showing up on the map or the location is not correct make sure that the Amulet is charged and turned on. If it is not then place it on the provided charging dock or plug it in using a micro USB. If it is charged and on then it may be that the Amulet needs to re-establish a connection with the satellite. In that case, place the Amulet outside or by a window so that it has a clear view of the sky. Give the Amulet about 5-10 minutes to re-connect to the satellite and refresh the map by terminating the app and re-opening it. If it is still not showing up try logging out of the app and logging back in. If none of these solutions work then please call customer service. The information for customer service is provided in the \"Customer Service\" secton below."),
                     FAQItem(question:"Does the Amulet need to be charged? How does this work?",answer:"Yes. The Amulet can last from 3-7 days. However, we recommend charging it every night, just as you would your cell phone. The Amulet comes with its own charging doc and cable. You can charge it by setting it in the doc, or plugging in the Amulet itself with a micro USB."),
                     FAQItem(question:"Does the Amulet work anywhere in the world?",answer:"The Amulet currently works in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and a few other countries. We are in the process of implementing a global plan and expect to have coverage globally shortly."),
                     FAQItem(question:"What happens if my cell phone is stolen along with my Aubry Lane bag?",answer:"You donât need your own cell phone to locate your bag! Just log into your Aubry Lane account on a computer or mobile device. We recommend having law enforcement help with recovery to keep you safe."),
                     FAQItem(question:"Is there a monthly fee for the Aubry Lane Amulet?",answer:"Because the Amulet is a cell phone, there is a cost with keeping it in service! However, weâre offering the first YEAR FREE! If youâd like to purchase more than one year of service, select it in the drop-down menu on each of our bags. \n\nIf you are purchasing the Amulet separately, we are currently offering the first 3 months for free, with an option to add on more time"),
                     FAQItem(question:"Where is the hidden pocket?",answer:"The hidden pocket is in the same place in each of our bags, behind the cell phone pocket. Pull up on either the left or right side of the cell phone pocket and you will find the opening."),
                     FAQItem(question:"What happens after I hit the SOS button?",answer:"First, the Amulet sends your exact geographic location, a text saying help me, and if youâre in motion to all your programmed emergency contacts. Then, it cycles through calling each one until you can reach someone. The text message from the Amulet tells you Date, Time, Speed, Altitude, Battery Percentage, and a Google Maps link to your/your bagâs exact location."),
