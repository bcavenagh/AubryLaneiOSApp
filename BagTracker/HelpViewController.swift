After that, an SOS alarm \"Help me!\" will be sent to all authorized phone numbers and to the platform. It will also dial the 5 authorized numbers in sequence. If the tracker fails to connect to the first number, it will call the second number after a delay of 10 seconds. (In this time the user can prevent a possible false alarm by pressing the SOS button). In case the second number fails to be connected as well, the system will connect to the third number, etc. Between each call it will have a 10 second delay where the user can press the SOS button to stop the call to the next number. \n\n    To end the call and sequence the user can press SOS button or the receiver of the call can press 1 on their mobile to stop it."),

Setting the device to X1 means it will call number A1 or your first emergency contact. Default setting is X2, which means it will call your second emergency contact."),
